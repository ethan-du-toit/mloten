In 1989 the Soviet government, armed with secret design documents
stolen from Nintendo, began development on a video game console,
codenamed "лучшийблок". Initial stages were promising, but after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the group responsible for this
project was privatised as "безудержное веселье ЗАО", roughly
translating as "Great Fun Inc." They attempted to market their
product, now completed, to Western investors - but noone wanted a
Russian clone of Nintendo when they could just buy from Nintendo
instead. Thus the company went bankrupt.

This is an emulated version of that console, packaged with the demo
game used to market it to Western investors. The game is called "Жизнь
парня с головой слона" or "The life of an elephant-headed guy."

Enjoy!
